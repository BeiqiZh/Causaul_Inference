# Causaul_Inference

- I will be looking at the effect of the new technology (New technology has been implemented after 2014) on surgical site infection (SSI).
- The new technolpgy is only used on platics surgery. Therefore, our treatment group will be the patients with Plastic = 1, and our control group will be the patients with Platics = 0.
- The exposure of the new technology can be correlated with the lower surgical site infection but in order to conclude a causal relationship, we will need to control all the confounders that could potentially be correlated with the new technology and cause lower SSI
- Condounders in this case will include: a patient's sex, type of surgery (CPT), age, height, weight, BMI, HyperMed, Dialysis, Diabete, Smoke, Level of importance
